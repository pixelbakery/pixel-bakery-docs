On this page you’ll learn how to take apparel inventory, how to update inventory on our website, and how to ship out merch orders.

# How to Take Apparel Inventory

Our inventory, backstock, and various other miscellaneous items are kept in a storage closet on the second floor, near flat 240.

Inventory is then counted by size / style, and can be entered into the [Merch and Apparel Inventory](https://pixelbakery.monday.com/boards/2302676846) monday.com board.

# How to Update Inventory on our website

Once inventory is taken, please update the inventory on our website. You do this by navigating to https://dashboard.chec.io/orders/, and the password to access this website is on https://1password.com/.

When you get to the page, it should look like this:

Navigate to the products tab on the left hand side. You should get to a screen that looks like this:

Click on a product you want to update, in this instance I will be using the Queer Existence tote bag as an example. The product page will look like this:

Click on “Inventory available” and enter the correct amount of inventory we have on hand, then click save changes. Then you’re done, and can update any additional inventory if needed!

# How to Update Inventory on our website

Will update when we actually have an order we need shipped.
