## Creating a New Board From The template

A pre-defined template has already been created for you. Simply navigate to the correct folder under the Project Management workspace, create a new board in it, and select the template _"Project Labor Tracking"_

## Monday Columns

**Item Name**
duh.

**Date**
Date of purchase, not today's date.

**Purchaser**
Person that did the buying, not you. Well, maybe you. idk.

**Category**
TRAVEL is for things like hotels, putting gas into your tank, etc. Opposed to MILEAGE, which is the standard mileage rate that we expense to our clients. See the Other Considerations section for more info on this.

**Receipt**
This MUST exist. Encourage employees to use Stride (iphone app) for mileage tracking. Sometimes in life they'll have to take a screenshot of some shit and send that to you. Sometimes you'll need to open the monday app on your phone and take a photo of a receipt in this column.

**Item Updates**
Sometimes Jordan looses receipts and needs to track them down. This would be a good thing to mention in an item update.

**Outstanding:**
Leave this blank if we don't owe anyone or anything money and we paid for the thingomabob on the spot. If, for example, a print shop sends us an invoice after the fact, change this to outstanding.

**Notes:**
Any additional information you find pertinent. For example, "Jordan needs to track down", a reason why we're not billing it, etc.

## Monday.com email template

Navigate to the Emails & Activities tab of the Updates section. Select 'New Email', and copy/paste these into the email. Before you hit send for the first time, make sure you save this as a template so you don't have to ever copy/paste it again.

Not mentioned in the video tutorial: Be sure to click on the attachments icon and select the receipt file from the receipts column. This lets QBO do its thing.

If you get a bounce-back on the email, it may mean you aren't set up as an authorized user in Quickbooks. Check with Jill to resolve.

## Other Considerations

ðŸ‘€ Sometimes it makes more sense to combine expenses into one line item. For example, we don't really want a client to have a thousand things on their invoice for Uber. Use dat simple addition for the item total, and attach all involved receipts. Maybe a good opportunity to make use of the notes column and mention how many individual trips there were. Idk, maybe you even get wild an make an Item Update that breaks down the different totals further Â¯\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯

ðŸ‘€ Putting gas into your tank is NOT something expensed to client. This is what the standard, federally-mandated mileage rate is ($0.625 at the time of writing). If an employee purchased gas on their personal card, they can be reimbursed for that purchase. If gas is purchased with a PB card, the receipt must still be entered into
