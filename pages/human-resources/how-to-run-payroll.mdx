1. Login to your 'admin' Gusto account.

2. Once you login, you'll want to check if you need to approve any time off from the past two weeks. If there aren't any that need to be approved from the past 2 weeks, we'll come back and approve later.

3. Next, you'll want to check if you need to approve any expenses. Any expenses that need to be approved will show up under 'needs review.'

4. Once you check those it's time to run payroll.

5. You'll want to login to Harvest. At the top menu bar click 'reports' go over to 'week' and press custome. Customize the dates to the payroll dates on Gusto.

6. Next, you'll add only the hourly employees to Gusto. 

7. When you press 'continue' on Gusto you'll see a page of time off hours. If you approved any time off hours Gusto will automatically add those here.

8. Press 'continue.' Make sure nothing looks suspicious or out of the ordinary. 

9. Press 'submit payroll.'

**GENERAL NOTE:** If you think you messed up on something you have time to cancel payroll and re-run if needed.
