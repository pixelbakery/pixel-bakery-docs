# Employee Welcome Email

Human,

Welcome to Pixel Bakery. We're glad you're here. Take pride in joining our team as our newest Baker. Our clients hire us because we're the best of the best, and as such, we're highly selective and only bring on the best of the best.

The next few weeks will be a whirlwind of excitement and information for you, so hang in there. While trust is built over time, you'll quickly learn that we take care of one another and always have each other's back. The learning curve can be steep at times, but you are surrounded by co-workers who are just as brilliant and compassionate as you are. Know that you can ask them for help, learn from them, and lean on them for guidance as your journey aligns with ours.

Before we delve into some of the more granular details about your position, I'd like to prepare you for your new role by providing a few insights on what to expect:

-   You are safe here. Pixel Bakery will always put your life before profit. This is a creative environment, and creativity can only exist inside an incubator warmed by vulnerability, transparency, communication, and inclusivity. We expect you to contribute to that environment and to speak up about policies, interactions, clients, and work that make you feel uncomfortable.

-   Our world is fast-paced and rapidly evolving. There isn't going to be a process doc or a reference template for everything you do. You're going to have to make some of it up as you go, and you're going to have to trust yourself. We wouldn't have hired you if we didn't think you have what it takes to make those judgment calls.

-   You're now a part of a grander plan. We're not here to design pamphlets for used car lots. We're here to build a more creative Nebraska, prop up designers in our community, and fight for social change. Every day is going to present itself with new opportunities and challenges. I can promise you that you will never be bored during your tenure with us.

You're about to receive a ton of different emails from the various platforms and systems that keep our ship moving forward. [Here's a breakdown](https://pixelbakery.co/recipes/an-introduction-to-our-technology-stack) of the main ones you'll use daily. Please take a moment to glance at it before your first day.

I'm so excited to have you join us, and I cannot wait to see the amazing things we build during our time together. Watching an employee transform into their fullest potential, grow, and learn with Pixel Bakery is one of the biggest reasons I love my job. Again, take a moment to compliment yourself. For every person, we hire there are, on average, 35 that we do not. You are a rare level of human and you are going to do great.
