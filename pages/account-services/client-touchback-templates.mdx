# Client Touchback & Initial Contact Templates

On this page you'll find some commonly used message templates we send to retain past clients and build new relationships. It's important to remember that these are only _templates_. Each and every client is special and important to us, so it's critical to remember to tailor each message specifically for that client. Being personable and relatable is the best way to build trust.
