# File and Information Classification

On this page you'll learn Pixel Bakery's four levels of file and information classification. This is very important. We can't have people finding out about the secret ingredients in our fried chicken.

## 1. Open Source 

Anything that we make that is designed to be publicly accessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit.

**EXAMPLE:** Open source animation files, website code… could be anything. Check our [education page](https://pixelbakery.com/education#projectFiles) for more examples.

## 2. Unclassified 

These are documents and data that can go out to whomever we want. They're public.

**EXAMPLE:** Things like open-source project files, final client deliverables, public presentations, etc.

**GENERAL NOTE:** Posting storyboards on personal portfolios are usually de-classified when we make a portfolio piece. If it's on our website, it can go on your portfolio.

## 3. Confidential

These are documents that can only be sent to approved people. Usually these are things we sent to clients or contractors. There is a chain of custody involved with these files. When we pass the custody off to the recipient, there is an expectation that they will not distribute it beyond their sphere of influence.

**EXAMPLE:** Storyboards, Milanote things, client cuts, slide decks, etc.

## 4. Internal Use Only + Confidential

This applies to both information AND files. Only Pixel Bakery employees and contractors that have signed NDAs can view them. They CANNOT leave our studio. You cannot show your mum. You cannot store them on an unauthroized computer/phone. You cannot take these documents with you if you leave PB.

**EXAMPLE:** Things like notes from client meetings, working files, raw footage, etc. Anything that is mission critical to our process.

**GENERAL NOTE:** Everything that is confidential and IUO has to be marked as such. That's why it's by default in the footer of our google docs template and on our storyboards.
