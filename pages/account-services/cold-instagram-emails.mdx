## First Attempt Template

Hi CHANGEME!

My name is Jordan Lambrecht and I'm the Director of Pixel Bakery Design Studio. We were talking to someone on your social team and they pointed us in your direction.

Pixel Bakery is a multidisciplinary production studio specializing in [motion design](https://pixelbakery.com/work/case-studies/oxbow-hay-the-oxbow-way?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=slide_deck_2022), [animated explainers](https://pixelbakery.com/work/case-studies/Onyx-Coffee-Journey?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=slide_deck_2022), [video production](https://pixelbakery.com/work/case-studies/sola-tiny-chef?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=slide_deck_2022), and [product photography](https://pixelbakery.com/work/case-studies/snacklins-content-kit?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=slide_deck_2022). We're all obsessed with CHANGEME's brand and your commitment to the quality of your product. It's really inspiring to see companies that genuinely believe in what they're selling.

If you’re down, I'd love to set up a meeting in the next couple weeks to get to know each other. I also put together a slide deck that shows off some of our services for you. See attached.

You can lock in a meeting here: [pixelbakery.com/book](https://pixelbakery.com/book).

Hi again!

I wanted to take a second and bump this back to the top of your inbox. Any chance you’d be interested in a meeting?

Thanks!

## Final Attempt Template

Hello!

I hope you’re doing well. Sorry for blowing up your inbox- we’re all huge fans, so I figured I'd fight a little for your business and hit you up one last time. Let me know if you’re interested in continuing the conversation, otherwise I’ll leave you alone after this =]

Thanks!

–J
