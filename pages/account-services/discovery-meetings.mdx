# Discvoery Meetings

We generally take discovery calls over Zoom. Someone should be assigned to taking notes. These notes can be uploaded anywhere to google drive or added directly as a[ Monday.com](https://pixelbakery.monday.com/boards/3241356106) document.

We're not really sure at this time how long Zoom recordings last within zoom, so we're being extra cautious by backing them up to Vimeo.

Steps to take after the meeting is over:

## Vimeo

1. Download the Zoom video and upload it to Vimeo
2. The Vimeo title format should be "Discovery Meeting â€“ Very Dope Company, Sept. 15th 2022"
3. Make sure the video is set to "unlisted"
4. Set the 'Customized Link' to the format of "discovery-client-name" under the Get Shared Link button
5. Move the vimeo video into the folder titled "Zoom Recordings"

## Monday

1. Head on over to [this monday board](https://pixelbakery.monday.com/boards/3241356106) and create a new item in the appropriate group.
2. Paste the unlisted vimeo link in the video column.
3. In the Notes column, either copy/paste your notes as a Monday document or attach them as a Google Doc.

Additional Step: take the directly shared Zoom Recording link and add it to the Zoom column.

Be sure you write who, from the clients' side, attented the meeting in the "In Attendance" column. Plz spell their name correctly ðŸ™ƒ. If they have a tricky name to pronounce, it's often helpful to include a pronounciation or a link to one of those YouTube "how to pronounce" videos in the Updates section.

Should a company sign on a client after a dicovery meeting, the item needs to be moved from the Discovery Meetings monday board to a client-specific meetinng recordings board in the Project Management workspace.
