# Honeybook & Harvest Training

Below are two training videos that help illustrate our workflow on how to use Honeybook and Harvest.

**Honeybook** is what we refer to as our "Clerical Software." We use it to:

- Send estimates
- Send contracts
- Send invoices / collect payment
- Gather brand exploration surveys from clients
- Organize client contact information (name, phone number, etc)

**Harvest** is a time tracking tool that all of our employees use. It serves the purpose of:

- tracking hours for part-time non-salaried employees. We use this information each pay period so we know how much to pay them.
  - Part-time non-salaried employees MUST track every hour, regardless if it's time spent on internal tasks or not.
  - Full-time employees do not need to track internal time, but they _must_ track time spent on client work.
- Track hours against projects. This allows us to determine how much of a project's budget has been spent and is remaining.

Accurate client time tracking is crucial to the success of Pixel Bakery. The information we gather allows us to look back at historical data and forcast the budget of future projects.
