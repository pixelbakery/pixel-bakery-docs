# Sending Decks to clients

**CREATING**

When refering to a client, it's best to use a chill name with them. If we're sending something to a client called Blackbird Foods, let's refer to them as Blackbird. Think about how you would talk to your friend about them as if you were a long-time customer/fan. This builds a level of familiarity with our clients.

Don't work off of Hot Storage, it gets annoying.

**EXPORTING**

1. In keynote go to File > Export To > PDF...
2. Make sure 'Best' is selected for Image Quality
3. Hit 'Next'
4. Since this is going to a client and is about US instead of work about THEM, we're going to use PixelBakery as the file prefix. No version is needed. Include an short (3 char or less) abbrev. of the client name. The file should be named something similar to the following: `PixelBakery_BB_ProductPhotographyExamples.pdf`
5. Slap dat export button. Try to save it to your desktop.

**COMPRESSING**

1. Open up Ilovepdf.com
2. Navigate to 'Compress PDF'
3. Get 'er uploaded
4. Select 'Less Compression' and hit Compress PDF
5. After it's done doing smart guy stuff, download it to your Downloads folder. We exported to your desktop from Keynote and downloaded the compressed version to your downloads folder to make your life easier in the next step.
6. Rename the file you just downloaded. ILovePDF will add the suffix '\_compressed' to the file. Get rid of that. This is the reason we downloaded it to a different folderâ€“ we don't have to overwrite the original exported file and we get less pop-up warnings.

**SENDING**

ALWAYZ double-check that all of your links work, you used the correct client name in the doc, and there are no spelling errors. And I swear to god if you spell the client name wrong imma get you.

After you've done all that, off she goes. Be sure to make a backup somewhere that isn't your computer (Monday update, the appropriate Google Drive folder, Hot Storage, etc).

Save a copy of the actual keynote to Hot Storage.
