## Creating

When refering to a client, it's best to use a chill name with them. If we're sending something to a client called Blackbird Foods, let's refer to them as Blackbird. Think about how you would talk to your friend about them as if you were a long-time customer/fan. This builds a level of familiarity with our clients.

There's a pdf in the folder called "PixelBakery_CapabilitiesDeck.pdf" already exported for you if you want to send a generic, unnamed version to someone.

## Exporting

1. Update the name of the client in inDesign on the first page.
2. Either go to File > Export or hit CMD + E on the keyboard
3. Name the document PixelBakery_Loves_NameOfCompany
4. Make sure the file type is set to 'PDF (Interactive)'
5. Hit the Export button
6. Double check that it exported correctly.

## Sending

ALWAYZ double-check that all of your links work, you used the correct client name in the doc, and there are no spelling errors. And I swear to god if you spell the client name wrong imma get you.

After you've done all that, off she goes. Be sure to update the corresponding Monday board to reflect that you sent the deck.
