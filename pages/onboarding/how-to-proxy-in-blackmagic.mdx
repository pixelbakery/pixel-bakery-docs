# How To: Proxy in DaVinci Blackmagic Proxy Generator 

Proxies help lighten the load on your computer while editing and make playback lightning fast, so it's worth it to take the time making proxies (especially for footage bigger than 4k).

You can make/manipulate proxies before or after you have your project setup (which is why it's great). You can also create proxies in **Blackmagic Proxy Generator (BMP** for short) while using **Davinci Resolve 18.**

## Creating Proxies

Let's open up Proxy Generator

You'll see 4 distinct sections

1.  **Processing**- tells you progress of proxy creation when it's going

2.  **Proxy Format** - selects the format of the proxies you're making, not the footage you have

3.  **Watch Folders** - a list of drives/folders **BMP** will look at

4. **Buttons** - Buttons

Let's get to makin' proxies!

-   Open Blackmagic Proxy Generator

-   Open the drive or folder you want to make proxies from

-   Import drive/folder by clicking **Add** then selecting it in **Finder** (or by dragging drive/folder into the **Watch Folders** section. You can add as many drives/folders as you'd like.
