# How To: Proxy in DaVinci Resolve 17


First things first, make sure your folder structure is set from the beginning.

1.  RAW footage (separate footage into subfolders if the project is large with multiple cams)

2.  Proxies (if necessary)

3.  Working files (only localized within the DaVinci file)

4.  Timelines (only inside the DaVinci file)

5.  Render Houses (only inside the DaVinci file)

6.  Assets (Illustrator working files, AE files, AE renders, etc.)

7.  VO (if necessary)

8.  Music & SFX

9.  Renders

NOW we can jump into proxying

-   Open DaVinci Resolve 17

-   Open new project

-   Drag and drop files that need to be proxied in the media pool (top left)

-   Choose Quicktime video format, H.264, NVIDIA encoder (if available), Medium quality, and -VERY IMPORTANT- deselect "Frame reordering" to experience a super-fast encode process.

-   Choose custom resolution of 960x540 (choose a larger resolution if you need to)
