# How To: Structure the Server

## Welcome to the New Server Structure

![Alt text](/img/new-server-structure.png 'title')

Starting this year (2022), we'll be transferring over to a new process for the server. Instead of moving clients/projects in and out of the "Clients - Active" folder, we will keep all projects in folders marked by the year they started.

Here are some examples:

-   We get BadApps in the new year, so we make a folder titled "BadApps" in the _2022 folder. If we get a project from them again the following year, we make a folder for the client in the _2023 folder.

-   Oxbow EveryBITE began in 2021, therefore will stay in that year's folder.

-   TA S01E01 started in 2021, therefore will stay in that year's folder. TA S01E02 will start in 2022, therefore we will make a new folder for TA in the _2022 folder.

*Each year will then be moved from hot storage to cold storage after two years.*

If you're doing **graphic design work** (ie. SNACKLINS emails, social posts, etc.), your folders should look like the following:

Project name

-   Working

-   Proofs

In the **working folder**, you can store all of your packaged Illustrator files/folders, like links and fonts. In the **proofs folder**, if you have multiple versions, create a "_History" folder within it and put the old versions in there. At the end of the project, only final files should be in the main "Proofs" folder.

If you're doing video and/or animation work, please organize your folders as stated in the [Davinci Resolve PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QWEKey7SLNVInbdBleMf_bFOk5yfAWzF/view?usp=sharing). Your Davinci and After Effects files folder structure should directly mimic that of what is in your server folder.
