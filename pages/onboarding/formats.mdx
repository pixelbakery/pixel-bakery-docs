# PB Terminology

**Resolution:** is the total amount of pixels

**The aspect ratio:** says that for every 16 pixels wide, there are 9 pixels high

## Formats

**.mov:** this is a high-quality video format used by the QuickTime framework. Think of these as "master copies" of the animation.

**.mp4:** MP4 is an international standard for audio-visual coding. MP4 is considered a digital multimedia container format- essentially a file containing a bunch of data that's been compressed, The standard specifies how the data is stored within the container itself, but not how that data is encoded. With the high degree of compression used in MP4 videos, this allows the files to be much smaller in size than other video formats. Reducing the file size doesn't immediately impact the quality of the file, either. Almost all of the original quality is retained. This makes MP4 a portable and web-friendly video format.

**.png:** A PNG file is an image file stored in the Portable Network Graphic (PNG) format. It contains a bitmap of indexed colors and uses lossless compression, similar to a .GIF file but without copyright limitations. PNG files are commonly used to store graphics for web images.

**.svg:** An SVG (scalable vector graphics) file is a graphics file that uses a two-dimensional vector graphic format created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It describes images using a text format that is based on XML. SVG files are developed as a standard format for displaying vector graphics on the web.

## What's a Rought Cut?

We always send a rough cut to clients, as a first glimpse to see how their animation or video project is coming together. Rough cuts are sent to give the client an idea of if the layout of the video matches what they are envisioning from earlier discussions, and the storyboards. We always preface to clients that the rough cut doesn't have any color grading, stabilizing, audio editing, sound effects, music, etc. All the pizazz will come once the lock in the shot sequence. A rough cut is a great time to ask clients if they have feedback on what they would like to see updated with the sequence before we start going in and doing the fine detail work (color grading, stabilizing, audio editing, SFX, music, etc.)

## So Why Don't We Add a Little Pizazz Early On?

It doesnâ€™t make sense for us to do a bunch of the detailed post-production early in the project. The likelihood of shots changing drastically is very high, clients always have nitty gritty feedback once they see it coming together. Essentially we would be doing a bunch of extra work, to end up backtracking and wasting money for no reason. **The client approving the sequence is one of the most crucial milestones that NEED to be signed off on in the process of animation or video.**
