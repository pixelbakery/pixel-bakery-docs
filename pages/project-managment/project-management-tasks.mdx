# Project Management Tasks

Daily, weekly, and monthly checklist. 

## DAILY

- Start each day with [Monday.com](http://www.monday.com)'s individual tasks board, making sure everyone's board is up-to-date for the day. Adjust individual tasks throughout the day based on revolving project priorities, new task updates, any roadblocks, etc.

- Check in on the Project Lifecycles board every day, as we're currently in the process of getting creatives to communicate through this board more than anywhere else. They will post project updates, deliverables, etc. here and update statuses accordingly. You will lead projects and communications through this board.

- Respond to all client emails in a timely manner (do not wait more than 24 hours). Be professional when talking to clients, always including an introduction and signoff.

- If starting a new project, schedule and lead a kickoff meeting with the Associate Creative Director to go over the creative brief, project timeline, and to cover any questions the creatives may have.

- Check in with clients if you need specific assets from them, if you are working collaboratively with them in pre-production (e.g. script), or if there are any adjustments in timeline to a project.

- Check in with new or active clients if a meeting would be timelier and more efficient for the studio to get certain questions answered or to discuss creative ideas. You can send meeting invites via [Calendly](http://calendly.com).

- Take meeting notes (either physically or digitally) for every client meeting, whether a potential or active client. Upload these to Google Drive in the client's designated folder, to the project's board in Monday.com, and send out to leadership immediately.

- Project manage realistic timelines and communicate that with the team & client.

- Monitor SNACKLINS to-do's closely and tasks delegate accordingly. They have their own Monday board, are VERY on top of their shit most of the time, and have no problem @ing us if things aren't up to their standards in terms of design or deadlines.

- Keep up with your individual to-do list amidst all of the above (this is the hardest).

## weekly

- Run a weekly standup meeting to get everyone talking face-to-face about project statuses and their individual to-do lists. Keep these meetings quick and efficient, but allot a full hour to cover any necessary ground. You will lead discussion, but keep in mind that this is a great time to get creatives away from their computers, cameras, etc. and interacting with one another. Hear them out and ask questions. These meetings are great for showcasing your leadership and listening skills.

- It is absolutely crucial to hit any promised deadlines. If a deadline absolutely cannot be hit, you **must** reach out to the client with an apology, reasoning for the delay, and a follow-up deadline they can expect. You **must** hit this follow-up deadline.

- Write any HoneyBook estimates for new clients by using our 'client onboarding' template. Make sure leadership is all on the same page in regards to budget and deliverables. **Always** have leadership check any estimates together before sending them to clients.

- Create recap emails for larger projects and important meetings with our to-do's and the client's action items. This doesn't need to be done very often, but it is a nice method to organize a lot of moving parts.

- Create new entries in Harvest for each project with their associated budgets, add appropriate people, and add all possible time clocking details.

- Stay on top of outstanding payments on Honeybook.

- Pay out any potential reimbursements for employee purchases.

## Monthly

- Print scripts, storyboards, and production sheets for shoots. Make multiple copies for the amount of people on set.

- Create production sheets in tandem with the director for larger shoots and act as a producer.

- Make sure all equipment is packed up for shoots alongside the lead cinematographer.

- Create folder structure on Google Drive and the server for projects to maintain organization and to give employees everything they need to be successful. Add to this when receiving new assets from the client, anytime there's an internal cut of something, or anytime you send a deliverable over to a client. Make sure to follow naming conventions.

- Be the primary communicator for creative contractors and make sure to pay them on time via Gusto. It is disrespectful to not pay them on time and could result in a bad (or no) relationship moving forward.

- Order any equipment we don't have and will need for a shoot. Make sure it gets packaged up nicely and get it sent back in time.
