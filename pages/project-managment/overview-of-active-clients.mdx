# Overview of Active Clients

*June 2022:* Overview of each client along with tips + tricks for working with them.

## Client: Nebraska Department of Transportation (NDOT)

#### 1. Main Point of Contact:

- Jeni Campana, Communications Manager

- [Jeni.Campana@Nebraska.gov](Jeni.Campana@Nebraska.gov)

- (402) 479-4512

#### 2. Project Overview:

- Day In The Life [Creative Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rXWivH91pBrwUy1RfTNErU-EEmQCfWUs5m4lIFm3FH4/edit)

- Your specific role in this pre-pro phase of this project is to help organize interviewees for filming at three separate NDOT locations: Lincoln, Omaha, and a western District (TBD). I have the Lincoln location scheduled out for the dates of 7/20-7/21 as of now, but no interviewees solidified at any of the locations yet. Mitchell will be handling all post-pro edits on this project.

#### 3. Communication TIPS & TRICKS

- There is a *large* list of contacts that were on the initial kickoff meeting. However, Jeni has taken over consolidating the interviewee list and HR communication on their end and has been a big help in getting us the right information.

- Communicate with her via email - she is very responsive and will get back to you within a few hours max. She's also super cool to talk to, so feel free to schedule a Zoom call with her if you feel as if you or Samee could use it. If you ever need to schedule a meeting with their whole crew, which she might ask of you at times, all of those contacts are below.

## Client: Educare Lincoln

#### 1. Main Point of Contact:

- Quentin Brown, Executive Director

- [quentin.brown@educarelincoln.org](quentin.brown@educarelincoln.org)

- (402) 458-3171

#### 2. Project Overview:

- Annual Review [Creative Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ahMw076lk9xNnI8ksnnMplIRZo10alIasIBtzE26JhE/edit)

- Educare is currently in pre-production. All possible assets have been handed off to us by the client and we're currently solidifying the script before moving forward into style frames, storyboards, asset creation, etc.

#### 3. Communication TIPS & TRICKS

- Quentin is DOPE as hell. Him and Jordan met at a networking event, and he's been such a chill client. Communicate with him via email - he is very responsive.

- He doesn't have much of a creative vision for this project and isn't really an artistic guy, so he puts a lot of trust in us to create a project that represents Educare Lincoln well. The only times you should need to communicate with him are to pass off deliverables to him for approval. He is very succinct in his wording via email, so if you ever need more clarification from him on a comment, set up a meeting with him.

## Client: Onyx Coffee Lab

#### 1. Main Point of Contact:

- Ivana Chan, Director of E-Commerce, 
- [ivana@onyxcoffeelab.com](ivana@onyxcoffeelab.com)

- CC: Jon Allen, Owner & Operator, 
- [jon@onyxcoffeelab.com](jon@onyxcoffeelab.com)

#### 2. Project Overview:

- Onyx Animation [Creative Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tBfR_SCCKr-MZUTGHJGnTBvE1c51J3byKP4RZmlkTEI/edit)

- Onyx is just getting started and we're super lucky to have them as a client. They are currently reviewing a few style frames Rebecca finished for them, and we're waiting for approval to move into storyboards. Rebecca will be taking on creating any assets, while we're going to work with a contractor to do the animation for us.

#### 3. Communication TIPS & TRICKS

- Similarly to Educare, you should only need to check in with the client from this point moving forward if you need to send any deliverables their way for approval. Both Ivana and Jon are VERY busy people, so reach out to them in advance if you have a question or need anything, as they'll take a little bit of time to respond. 

- Again, we're super super lucky to have them as a client, as they were initially hesitant about working with outside vendors, so make this experience for them as pleasant and easy-going as possible.

## Client: Marq (formerly known as Lucidpress)

#### 1. Main Point of Contact:

- Katie Krongard, Sr. Content Marketing Manager

- [kkrongard@lucidpress.com](kkrongard@lucidpress.com)

- John Perry (he goes by Perry), Creative Director

- [jperry@lucidpress.com](jperry@lucidpress.com)

- Lauren Hamberg, Head of Product Marketing

- [lhamberg@lucidpress.com](lhamberg@lucidpress.com)

#### 2. Project Overview:

- Marq Explainer [Creative Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YUkspDGmM32X_zlRl2eWWHJD6W1OO4ROz_YMc_C2G-8/edit)

- Marq has been a very slow-moving project, as the client is going through their whole rebranding process and it's taken a while to get assets and script from them. They have a pretty clear vision of what they want in this video, which is outlined in the script and creative brief. Once the script is solidified, the project will take off and you can follow all of the due dates I've set up on Monday.com for deadlines.

#### 3. Communication TIPS & TRICKS

- Katie, Perry, and Lauren are all super easy-going. I usually just contact all three of them, or contact Katie and CC the other two if I have any questions or need something. They're sometimes responsive and sometimes not, so you may need to reach out more than once if you haven't heard back on an email. 

- You shouldn't need to call them for anything, but they are all young and like to chat, so they like having Zoom calls with our team to check in.

## Clients: UNL – NE Governance & Technology Center (Technologue Americana)

#### 1. Main Point of Contact:

- Gus Hurwitz, Law Professor at UNL, Camera Enthusiast, Host of Technologue Americana and 1L2A, but mainly, just a Cool Guy™

- Email for **Technologue Americana ONLY:** [ghurwitz@unl.edu](ghurwitz@unl.edu)

- Email for ICLE projects: [ghurwitz@gmail.com](ghurwitz@gmail.com)

#### 2. Project Overview:

1. Technologue Americana Episode 02 [Creative Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWe6hI2P2PaB9J6l_UWVjsnB9dn_fVSQnKt-d-a_Dn4/edit)

    - Samee and I weren't here for Episode 01 of TA, so there was no creative brief coming into the project, but Episode 02's creative brief will give you a good idea of the flow of each episode. Basically, each episode hones in on one specific piece of technology that is overlooked, but impacts each of us every day. The first episode's focus was roads, and the second was silos. This third episode is in the pre-production phase and will focus on fiber internet.

    - All of these episodes have taken a similar approach: Gus decides on a topic for the episode and which companies or people he'd like to talk to, and you're in charge of scheduling the interviews for the episode. Then, the episodes are reviewed to figure out the best material from each and a creative brief, episode outline, and script is written around the interviews.

    - You're in charge of working with Jonathan, our copywriting contractor, to make sure he has all of the materials he needs to write the episode's script. Set up a kickoff meeting with him and Samee to go over the brief together and to answer any of his questions.

    - After a finalized script, the team will go through and creatively brainstorm B-Roll or additional footage to capture that would tell the story well, paired with animation. You're in charge of scheduling these additional shoot days and making sure the team's schedule and Gus' align with wherever the shoot will be held. Once this is done, interviews and B-Roll can start being edited by the team, and ideas for animation with associated timelines can start being implemented.

    - This project is a LOT of work, if you can't tell. Feel free to duplicate any of my past T.A. boards and to ask any questions to Samee or Jordan throughout the process. Just make sure you're talking to the right people and being communicative.

2. 1L2A [Creative Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XGtjz3rRZnvgS6iuzDQxgJciEIMe2jdXxxyKuM7-EVU/edit)

    - 1L2A is a super chill and fun project with Gus. Everything's already pretty laid out and is easy for a new PM to jump in. [Here's a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wQjo_aJyh_OXm_q8Zd2FMakyOJP1uF68tLCqXQI9Des/edit#gid=0) that Gus has access to which lists out upcoming interviewees. Gus will do an introduction email to introduce you to the guests, but they will already know the premise of the show and have agreed to be on it.

    - All you'll need to do is schedule a one-hour time slot that works for Gus, Mitchell, Samee, and the episode's guest. Once you solidify a date, add it to Google Calendar and [send them this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xSorSItED5-2Mvl79KzzK-y-7UZXXVSdFrGYxeecmGU/edit#) in PDF format for them to review, letting them know that the link to join the call is towards the bottom of the doc.

    - The day before their episode, remind them of the time and make sure to send over their initial [responses from this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RIfyYvynfT1on2PVJTe5HDC0vcjxLWBPBw0SY5UpKN0/edit#gid=680787031) (Gus' spreadsheet) to refresh them on what the discussion will include.

    - After the shoot has concluded and after the interview has been uploaded to Vimeo, you'll send that over to Gus for him to generate a transcript, and copy and paste that .txt file into one of our PB templated Google Docs. Send both the video and transcript in PDF format to the interviewee for them to select specific moments that they'd like to see animation. Then, timeline out the animation process for the team, keeping budget in mind for each episode.

3. Legacy Series (No CB)

    - Legacy is also another easy project. Basically, Gus selects a location once a month that he can sit down and have discussions with world-renowned lawyers or economists. The purpose of the series is to document their contributions to their fields. We are currently not editing these more than color grading.

    - Your job will be, once Gus has decided on a location and timeframe, to find plane tickets for the team (if necessary), hotel rooms, and to write out a schedule for the shoot date(s). You may or may not be in charge of communicating with and scheduling the interviewees.

#### 3. Communication TIPS & TRICKS

- Gus is theeeee best client, and he adores us for some unknown reason. We have a separate Slack workspace with him and channels for each of his projects. He is very responsive, and I always communicate with him via Slack. We have been doing weekly Friday meetings with him to run through any updates on each project, so you'll be in charge of scheduling those. 

- For scheduling, he is a super busy guy and I always double-check with him before scheduling anything, even if it's an available time in his calendar. He tends to move things around a lot and add things, so just check in with him often.

## Client: Raikes Beef

#### 1. Main Point of Contact:

- Lindsey Raikes

- [lindsey@raikesbeef.co](lindsey@raikesbeef.co) 

- Cell: (509) 981-1938

#### 2. Project Overview:

- Raikes Makes [Creative Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-ovMFAr3ujtFIvEqb3b7dXldIkCfX5xVVW4ybgxWXN8/edit)

- Raikes Makes is a super easy-going project. You'll be in charge of setting up meetings to kick off the discussion for each episode. Samee and Lindsey (and Mitchell can be there!) will solidify the episode's key message and general outline, and then you can take charge on scheduling for that.

#### 3. Communication TIPS & TRICKS

- LINDSEY IS MY FAVORITE CLIENT EVER. She is so so so chill. She is very responsive via email but has also texted me before for any info closer to shoot dates. 

- She likes seeing shot lists and loves chatting via meetings, so share any and all info with her for projects.
