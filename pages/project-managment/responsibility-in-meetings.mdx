# A Project Manager's Responsibility in Meetings

## Here are the different types of meetings you'll encounter at PB:

-   **Discovery meeting:** The first time you'll meet a client, either face-to-face or virtually

-   **Internal kickoff meeting:** Once you have the creative brief complete, you'll have an internal kickoff meeting to walk through it and the project's timeline

-   **Client kickoff meeting:** After an internal kickoff meeting, you'll meet with the client to discuss action items for the project, to go over the creative brief, and to answer any questions they have before PB gets started

-   **Pre-pro meeting with client:** Happens sometime during the pre-production phase of a project. If a script is being written collaboratively, if you're discussing VO artists, etc., this is a great time to talk about all of that. It's also great to discuss storyboards or any pre-pro assets that have been sent over to make sure everything is approved, signed off on, and moving in the right direction.

-   **Meeting with contractor:** Very similar to an internal kickoff meeting, and may even merge into one, if possible, but this is to get a contractor on the same page as the team and to make sure they have all the materials they need to get started.

-   **Stand-up meetings:** Internal, weekly meetings with your team!

## Your role in each meeting:

-   **Discovery meeting:** In discovery meetings, the PM is responsible for taking as thorough of notes as possible. Get every single detail you can, and feel free to ask questions to make sure you're covering all bases. Jordan will run the show, Samee will ask specific questions on creative vision, but you'll be in charge of documenting absolutely everything. Your notes will then be used to draft a detailed estimate for the client, and every factor affects an estimate (timeline, budget, project type, length, etc.).

-   **Internal kickoff meeting:** Samee will lead the show on these, running through the creative brief with the team that will be assigned to a project. Take notes if the creatives have any insight, questions, etc. You'll be in charge of running through the timeline that you'll add to the bottom of the creative brief. Make sure that the timeline is reasonable for the creatives and run through the specific tasks that will be asked of each of them.

-   **Client kickoff meeting:** Meeting notes for these will generally be pretty concise, unless there's an action item brought up that's not already documented. You'll be leading these meetings, running through the project timeline and next steps with the client and with Samee. This is a great time for them to ask questions and for you to let them know when you'll be sending deliverables over (represented by milestones in Monday).

-   **Pre-pro meeting with client:** Take lots of notes if necessary, but lead the show by running through any recent deliverables or milestones the team has hit and let them know what's coming up next.

-   **Meeting with contractor:** You'll be leading these in tandem with Samee, letting a contractor know what's expected of them and what a project timeline is. Take notes if needed. Make sure to answer any and all questions from the contractor. Also, make sure they have any materials they need to get rolling.

-   **Stand-up meetings:** These are your meetings to lead. You'll talk through each person's individual tasks and run through projects to make sure that everyone is on target to hitting deadlines and to help alleviate any stress if someone has too much going on. You can also discuss any announcements, etc.
