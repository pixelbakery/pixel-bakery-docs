# How to: Track and Submit Expense Reimbursements to Clients

On this page you'll learn how we track expense reimbursements that need to be sent out to a client for a project on Monday.com. You'll also learn how to make the invoice and submit these expenses to the client through Honeybook.

**GENERAL NOTE:** Expenses will be given to you either by email or by a physical receipt.

**In addition to expense tracking, once the project is completed and there aren’t anymore expenses, you’ll need to create an invoice in Honeybook and send it to client to pay.**

Since the ICLE — Legacy Series invoice has been sent and paid already we’ll work with ICLE — Public Choice Economics.

The only note I have on the second video is after I copied and pasted the text to send to Gus via email, make sure you personalize it to that project. So instead of “Here's the expense reimbursement invoice for the Case Studies Production.” You’ll change it to “Here's the expense reimbursement invoice for Public Choice Economics.”
