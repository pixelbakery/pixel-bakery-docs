# How to: Offboard a Project

Congratulations! You and the team just finished a project. The sense of relief and accomplishment must be intoxicating. Before we can totally wash our hands of this project, we have to offboard it.

## Build team to-dos

The build team is any animator, designer, or videographer that's actively working on the project.

1.  Make sure all of your hours are logged in Harvest.

2.  Clean up the server and make sure everything is named appropriately and all files only have what is necessary for them. You can check your work by reviewing [Pixel Bakery File Structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NZ1Hx738ulahffCYQt3vbrS_xl-vZmW3QdclGOebltE/edit).

3.  Clean up Vimeo and any old versions of the video to a History folder. Only leave what was last given to the client in the main project folder.

## Project manager to-dos

1.  Review Honeybook and make sure the client has paid the entire invoice.

2.  Review Harvest and make sure everyone has input all of their hours and that the budget matches Honeybook.

3.  Input all of the info from Harvest into the [Project Margins Tracking board](https://pixelbakery.monday.com/boards/2953605944) on Monday.

4.  Input the necessary information for the [List of Projects board](https://pixelbakery.monday.com/boards/2365905663) on Monday.

5.  Archive the project on Honeybook.

6.  Archive the project on Harvest.

7.  If the potential for a new project with the client in the next 3 months is low, archive the Slack channel.

8.  Send the client a Google Form to review our process and performance.

9.  Set up an internal debrief meeting with the team with an agenda.
